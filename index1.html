              Sutomo School was formerly called Sutung School (蘇東; "East
              Sumatra") when it was established in 1926. On 25 February 1958,
              the name of the school was changed to Sutomo School in conjunction
              with the establishment of Sutomo Education Foundation by Soo Lean
              Toii, Oei Moh Toan, and Hadi Kusuma (Khoo Peng Huat).

                        <p>
                          The 27th Sutomo 1 Annual Contest, part of the P2S1
                          event, took place from the first week of January 2024
                          and concluded in the first week of March 2024. During
                          this period, a total of 48 different competitions were
                          held. This year's event saw tremendous engagement
                          which reflected the wide interest and enthusiasm of
                          the student body.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Challenge</h5>
                        <p>
                          The P2S1 event has been a long-standing tradition at
                          the school, but for the past two years, it was unable
                          to be held in its usual offline format due to the
                          global pandemic. Thankfully, this year, the event was
                          able to resume its offline celebration, marking a
                          triumphant return to the in-person format that
                          students have missed.

                          The success of the 27th Sutomo 1 Annual Contest would
                          not have been possible without the active
                          participation of the students. The event was a
                          significant achievement, and all of the champions are
                          to be congratulated for their exceptional
                          performances. For those who did not make it into the
                          top 3, it is important to remember that there is
                          always room for growth and improvement, and future
                          opportunities will allow them to shine even brighter.
